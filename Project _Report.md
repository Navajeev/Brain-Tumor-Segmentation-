# Brain Tumor Segmentation using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project automates brain tumor segmentation from MRI scans using Python, OpenCV, and Streamlit. It helps doctors identify tumor regions more efficiently and accurately, reducing manual work and improving diagnosis speed.

## Skills Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Computer Vision
- Streamlit
- Image Segmentation

## Problem Statement
Manual brain tumor segmentation is time-consuming and prone to human error.
This project uses computer vision techniques to detect and segment tumors automatically from MRI images,
which can improve diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Features
- Upload MRI images
- Automated segmentation using OpenCV
- View original and segmented images
- User-friendly Streamlit interface


## Project Files
- `app.py` – Streamlit web application
- `segmentation.py` – Tumor segmentation logic
- `requirements.txt` – Required libraries
- `README.md` – Project documentation
